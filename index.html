          <h6>Senior Software Engineer</h6>
          <div class="panel_website"><a href="http://www.mcafee.com/" target="_blank">www.mcafee.com</a></div>

          <p>Damon had his first computer, an Apple II+, when he was 10, and knew that he wanted to be a programmer from the time he learned BASIC on it. His first programming job was writing microcontroller firmware for an industrial company. On the side, he wrote a plug-in to add PGP encryption to Eudora Mail, which wound up getting him a job in Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom. PGP was acquired by McAfee, then sold off during the dot-com bust, but he managed to stay on with McAfee, and he's been writing security software there ever since. He's been with the company for 15 years and has learned a variety of programming languages, software development methods, and project management styles.</p>

          <p>Known to friends as Chappy, Dan Chapman has been remarkably lucky in regards to having his interests and whims take him to the far reaches of the interactive galaxy. He has made up for his lack of attention span with a genuine commitment to making sure that people love the work he does for them. "I am so touched that the students of AiPD's web program have chosen me as this conversation's moderator. The years I spent teaching and administering the program are some of my most cherished. The care and feeding of an interactive team is both art and science, not for the faint of heart. I am thoroughly looking forward to exploring this topic with the panelists."</p>
