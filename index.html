          <p>I had my first computer, an Apple II+, when I was 10, and knew that I wanted to be a programmer from the time I learned BASIC on it. My first programming job was writing microcontroller firmware for an industrial company. On the side, I wrote a plug-in to add PGP encryption to Eudora Mail, which wound up getting me a job in Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom. PGP was acquired by McAfee, then sold off during the dot-com bust, but I managed to stay on with McAfee, and I’ve been writing security software there ever since. I’ve been with the company for 15 years and have learned a variety of programming languages, software development methods, and project management styles.</p>
