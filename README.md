## Important Directories and Files

### /_includes

The `_includes` directory contains the `JB` folder which handles setup and gives
us some handy helpers, and the `themes` folder where a great deal of our work
will reside. I've created a `dev` theme for us to work with here and provided
some basic structure for us to build on top of.

### /_layouts

Don't touch! These files are pointing to the layouts inside of the theme folder.

### /_plugins

Don't touch! We probably won't need to use anything here at all.

### /_posts

The `_posts` directory contains all of the date-specific posts that will show up
on the site. Think of it as a blogging directory. This folder should only
contain markdown files (`.md` extension), and the filename takes a specific
form: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-separated-by-dashes.md`

I've included a sample post at `_posts/2012-10-14-sample-post.md`.

### /_site

Don't touch! This folder contains the site as generated by Jekyll. It's ignored
by git and will be overwritten whenever you change in the rest of the project.

### assets

This directory includes all static assets -- CSS and JS -- that we'll be using.
It's grouped by theme, so the stuff that concerns us is in `/assets/themes/dev/`
for now. I've already included some basic stuff for us.

### _config.yml

This file is very important -- it contains a lot of metadata that Jekyll uses
to figure out how to generate the site. Please don't edit this file without
checking with Nate first.

### index.md

This is the home page.

### atom.xml

This is an automatically generated ATOM feed, pretty much the same thing as RSS.
Jekyll Bootstrap defaults to this but we can also include an RSS feed later if
necessary. See [this thread on SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6619717/what-is-the-difference-between-rss-and-atom-feeds) for more on the difference.

### Everything else

Should be ignored for now.

## Guidelines

### Git

Please be conscious of what files you are committing. When possible,
Try to add and commit specific files with a commit message that tells us what
changes you made instead of adding all files you changed each time. For example,
instead of `git add .`, you could do `git add assets/css/style.css` and
`git commit -m 'added button styles'` or something like that. This will help us
all to know what's going on without having to dig through code and commits too
much.
